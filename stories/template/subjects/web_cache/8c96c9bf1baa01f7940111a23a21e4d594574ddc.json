Following his death in The Avengers, Fury resurrected Coulson using T.A.H.I.T.I., and had his memories of the project replaced. Coulson puts together a team of agents, and they travel the world dealing with strange new cases. During this time, Hydra is revealed to have infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D., leading to the latter's demise.
