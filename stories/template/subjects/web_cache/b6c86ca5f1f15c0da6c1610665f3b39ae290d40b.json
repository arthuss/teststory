  "text": "In Christian angelology, dominions or dominations (lat. dominatio, plural dominationes, also translated from the Greek term kyriotētes, pl. of kyriotēs, as \"Lordships\") are a class of angels. They are mentioned in the Bible, as stated in Colossians 1:16: \n\n\"For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him.\"\nPseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite ranks dominions as 4th in his angelic hierarchy.\nDominions are seen in the Seventh Heaven by Enoch according to the Second Book of Enoch.\n\n\n== References ==",
