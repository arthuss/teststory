  "text": "A watcher (Aramaic עִיר ʿiyr, plural עִירִין ʿiyrin, Greek: ἐιρ or ἐγρήγορος, egrḗgoros) is a type of biblical angel. The word is related to the root meaning to be awake. It occurs in both plural and singular forms in the Book of Daniel, where reference is made to the holiness of the beings. The apocryphal Books of Enoch (2nd–1st centuries BC) refer to both good and bad Watchers, with a primary focus on the rebellious ones.\n\n\n== Good watchers in Daniel ==\nIn Daniel 4:13, 17, 23 there are three references to the class of \"watcher, holy one\" (\"watcher\", Aramaic ʿir; \"holy one\", Aramaic qaddish). The term is introduced by Nebuchadnezzar who says he saw \"a watcher, a holy one come down (singular verb) from heaven.\" He describes how in his dream the watcher says that Nebuchadnezzar will eat grass and be mad and that this punishment is \"by the decree of the watchers, the demand by the word of the holy ones\" ... \"that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men.\" After hearing the king's dream, Daniel considers for an hour and then responds:\n\nAnd whereas the king saw a holy watcher coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave its stump and roots in the ground, with a band of iron and bronze, in the grass of the field, and let him be bathed with the dew of heaven, and let his lot be with the animals of the field, until seven times pass over him’— this is the interpretation, O king, and it is a decree of the Most High that has come upon my lord the king: You shall be driven away from human society, and your dwelling shall be with the wild animals. You shall be made to eat grass like oxen, you shall be bathed with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, until you have learned that the Most High has sovereignty over the kingdom of mortals and gives it to whom he will. Daniel 4:23–25 (NRSVue)\nLutheran Protestant reformer Johann Wigand viewed the watcher in Nebuchadnezzar's dream as either God himself, or the Son of God. He promoted Trinitarian thinking by linking verse 17 (\"The sentence is rendered by decree of the watchers\") with verse 24 (\"this is the interpretation, O king, and it is a decree of the Most High that has come upon my lord the king:\").\nScholars view these \"watchers, holy ones\" as perhaps showing an influence of Babylonian religion, that is an attempt by the author of this section of Daniel to present Nebuchadnezzar's Babylonian gods recognizing the power of the god of Israel as \"Most High\". The Greek Septuagint version differs from the Aramaic Masoretic Text: for example, the Aramaic text is ambiguous about who is telling the story of verse 14, whether it is Nebuchadnezzar, or the watcher in his dream.\n\n\n== Books of Enoch ==\nThe first Book of Enoch devotes much of its attention to the fall of the watchers. The Second Book of Enoch addresses the watchers (Gk. egrḗgoroi) who are in fifth heaven where the fall took place. The Third Book of Enoch gives attention to the unfallen watchers.\nThe use of the term \"watchers\" is common in the Book of Enoch. The Book of the Watchers (1 Enoch 6–36) occurs in the Aramaic fragments with the phrase irin we-qadishin, \"Watchers and Holy Ones\", a reference to Aramaic Daniel. The Aramaic irin \"watchers\" is rendered as \"angel\" (Greek angelos, Coptic malah) in the Greek and Ethiopian translations, although the usual Aramaic term for angel malakha does not occur in Aramaic Enoch.\nSome have attempted to date this section of 1 Enoch to around the 2nd–1st century BC and they believe this book is based on one interpretation of the Sons of God passage in Genesis 6, according to which angels mated with human females, giving rise to a race of hybrids known as the Nephilim. The term irin is primarily applied to disobedient watchers who numbered a total of 200, and of whom their leaders are named; but equally Aramaic iri (\"watcher\" singular) is applied to the obedient archangels who chain them, such as Raphael (1 Enoch 22:6).\n\n\n===",
