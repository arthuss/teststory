  "text": "'Pataphysics (French: 'pataphysique) is a sardonic \"philosophy of science\" invented by French writer Alfred Jarry (1873–1907) intended to be a parody of science. Difficult to be simply defined or pinned down, it has been described as the \"science of imaginary solutions\".\n\n\n== Introduction ==\n'Pataphysics was a concept expressed by Jarry in a mock-scientific manner, with undertones of spoofing and quackery, as expounded in his novel Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician. Here, Jarry toyed with conventional concepts and interpretations of reality. Another attempt at a definition interprets 'pataphysics as an idea that \"the virtual or imaginary nature of things as glimpsed by the heightened vision of poetry or science or love can be seized and lived as real\". Jarry defines 'pataphysics in a number of statements and examples, including that it is \"the science of imaginary solutions, which symbolically attributes the properties of objects, described by their virtuality, to their lineaments\". A practitioner of 'pataphysics is a pataphysician or a pataphysicist.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\nOne definition of 'pataphysics is that it is \"a branch of philosophy or science that examines imaginary phenomena that exist in a world beyond metaphysics; it is the science of imaginary solutions.\" Jean Baudrillard defines 'pataphysics as \"the imaginary science of our world, the imaginary science of excess, of excessive, parodic, paroxystic effects – particularly the excess of emptiness and insignificance\".\nThere are over one hundred definitions of 'pataphysics. Some examples are shown below.\n\n'Pataphysics is the science of that which is superinduced upon metaphysics, whether within or beyond the latter's limitations, extending as far beyond metaphysics as the latter extends beyond physics. ... 'Pataphysics will be, above all, the science of the particular, despite the common opinion that the only science is that of the general. 'Pataphysics will examine the laws governing exceptions, and will explain the universe supplementary to this one.\n\n'Pataphysics is patient; 'Pataphysics is benign; 'Pataphysics envies nothing, is never distracted, never puffed up, it has neither aspirations nor seeks not its own, it is even-tempered, and thinks not evil; it mocks not iniquity: It is enraptured with scientific truth; it supports everything, believes everything, has faith in everything, and upholds everything that is.\n\n'Pataphysics passes easily from one state of apparent definition to another. Thus it can present itself under the aspect of a gas, a liquid or a solid.\n\n'Pataphysics \"the science of the particular\" does not, therefore, study the rules governing the general recurrence of a periodic incident (the expected case) so much as study the games governing the special occurrence of a sporadic accident (the excepted case). [...] Jarry performs humorously on behalf of literature what Nietzsche performs seriously on behalf of philosophy. Both thinkers in effect attempt to dream up a \"gay science\" whose joie de vivre thrives wherever the tyranny of truth has increased our esteem for the lie and wherever the tyranny of reason has increased our esteem for the mad.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word 'pataphysics is a contracted formation that derives from the Greek τὰ ἐπὶ τὰ μεταφυσικά (tà epì tà metaphusiká). It is a phrase/expression that mean \"that which is above metaphysics\". It is itself a sly variation on the title of Aristotle's Metaphysics, which in Greek is \"τὰ μετὰ τὰ φυσικά\" (tà metà tà phusiká).\n\nJarry mandated the inclusion of the apostrophe in both the words 'pataphysique and 'pataphysics \"... to avoid a simple pun\". The words pataphysician or pataphysicist and the adjective pataphysical should not include the apostrophe. Only when consciously referring to Jarry's science itself should the word 'pataphysics carry the apostrophe. \nThe term pataphysics is a paronym (considered a kind of pun in French) of metaphysics. Since the apostrophe in no way a",
