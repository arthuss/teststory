  "text": "Trees are mentioned multiple times in the Book of Mormon, one of the sacred texts of the Christian Latter Day Saint movement. While often employed in metaphors or parables, they are explicitly referenced far less frequently. Trees have also found a place in Latter Day Saint culture, with passages related to them being utilized by critics of Mormonism.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTrees described in the Book of Mormon have been associated with inspirations drawn from various sources. The cosmic tree, often considered the center of the world, is a widespread motif found in the myths and oral traditions of numerous cultures, particularly those of Asia, Australia, and North America. Generally, two main forms of this motif are distinguished, which, using biblical terminology, can be identified as the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\nThe tree of life is a symbol rich in meaning, appearing in religious art, architecture, and literature across different historical periods. In the biblical context, it is referenced not only in the Book of Genesis but also in the Book of Proverbs. More detailed descriptions of the tree of life can be found in apocryphal texts. For instance, 1 Enoch 32:5 describes it as fragrant and bearing fruit similar to grapes. Another text, discovered in Egypt in 1945, portrays the tree of life as beautiful, fiery, and bearing fruits resembling white grapes.\nThe presence of trees has also been noted in several visions or dreams experienced by Joseph Smith Sr. (notably in 1811 and 1813) and Lucy Mack Smith. These experiences may have influenced the depictions of trees that appear in the Book of Mormon.\n\n\n== Trees as symbolic tools ==\nTrees are featured in the Book of Mormon in various contexts, often serving as metaphors, comparisons, allegories, and parables. In the vision seen by the patriarch Lehi and his son Nephi, the tree of life symbolizes the love of God. It also represents the Lamb of God. The fruit of this tree is described as the greatest of all God's gifts. This vision has been identified as central to the Christology of the Book of Mormon, refocusing attention on Jesus Christ as the primary instrument of salvation and calling for reconciliation among all living beings.\nAlma reminded the people of Zarahemla about God's invitation to all mortals to partake of the fruit of the tree of life, come unto Christ, repent, and be baptized. This message is detailed in Alma 5:34–36 and Alma 5:62. Alma also taught that the tree of life grows from the seed or word of God planted and nurtured in the heart of an individual, as recorded in Alma 32:37–43.\nThe Book of Mormon also references the tree of life in the Garden of Eden. In a blessing to his son Jacob, Lehi explained that the tree existed as a necessary counterpart to the tree of forbidden fruit, in accordance with 2 Nephi 2:15. Scholars have noted the absence of direct mention of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the Book of Mormon. This omission might stem from the Mormon interpretation of the Fall, which significantly differs from other Christian denominations, as it essentially excludes the concept of original sin.\nIn another metaphorical use of trees, Jacob speaks of Zenos' allegory of the olive tree. In this allegory, the house of Israel is compared to an olive tree. The allegory discusses events from both the past and the future, particularly regarding the scattering and gathering of the covenant people, illustrated through descriptions of digging, pruning, and nurturing the olive tree. These actions are notably referenced in Jacob 5:11.\nThe peoples described in the Book of Mormon viewed themselves as a severed branch of the House of Israel, as mentioned in 1 Nephi 19:24 and Alma 26:36. Their prophets, including Joseph, the son of Jacob, taught that in the last days, the Gentiles would help them return to the covenant and become a rightful branch, as seen in various verses in 1 Nephi.\nIn the Book of Mormon, trees, which bear bo",
