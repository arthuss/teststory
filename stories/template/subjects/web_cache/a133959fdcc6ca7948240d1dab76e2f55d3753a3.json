  "text": "Hermes Trismegistus (from Ancient Greek: Ἑρμῆς ὁ Τρισμέγιστος, \"Hermes the Thrice-Greatest\") is a legendary Hellenistic period figure that originated as a syncretic combination of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. He is the purported author of the Hermetica, a widely diverse series of ancient and medieval pseudepigraphica that laid the basis of various philosophical systems known as Hermeticism.\nThe wisdom attributed to this figure in antiquity combined a knowledge of both the material and the spiritual world, which rendered the writings attributed to him of great relevance to those who were interested in the interrelationship between the material and the divine.\nThe figure of Hermes Trismegistus can also be found in both Muslim and Baháʼí writings. In those traditions, Hermes Trismegistus has been associated with the prophet Idris (the Biblical Enoch).\n\n\n== Origin and identity ==\n\nHermes Trismegistus may be associated with the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. Greeks in the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt identified Thoth with Hermes through the interpretatio graeca. Consequently, the two gods were worshiped as one, in what had been the Temple of Thoth in Khemenu, which was known in the Hellenistic period as Hermopolis.\nHermes, the Greek god of interpretive communication, was combined with Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom. The Egyptian priest and polymath Imhotep had been deified long after his death, and therefore assimilated to Thoth in the classical and Hellenistic periods. The renowned scribe Amenhotep and a wise man named Teôs were coequal deities of wisdom, science, and medicine; and, thus, they were placed alongside Imhotep in shrines dedicated to Thoth–Hermes during the Ptolemaic Kingdom.\nCicero enumerates several deities referred to as \"Hermes\":\n\n\"fourth Mercury (Hermes) was the son of the Nile, whose name may not be spoken by the Egyptians\"\n\"the fifth, who is worshiped by the people of Pheneus [in Arcadia], is said to have killed Argus Panoptes, and for this reason to have fled to Egypt, and to have given the Egyptians their laws and alphabet: It is him whom the Egyptians call Theyt\"\nThe most likely interpretation of this passage is as two variants on the same syncretism of Greek Hermes and Egyptian Thoth (or sometimes other gods): The fourth (where Hermes turns out \"actually\" to have been a \"son of the Nile\", (i.e. a native Egyptian god) is the Egyptian perspective, the fifth (who went from Greece to Egypt) is the Arcadian Greek perspective. Both of these early references in Cicero (the oldest Trismegistus material is from the early centuries CE) corroborate the view that Thrice-Great Hermes originated in Hellenistic Egypt through syncretism between Greek and Egyptian gods (the Hermetica refer most often to Thoth and Amun).\nThe Hermetic literature of the Egyptians was concerned with conjuring spirits and animating statues, the newly developed practice of alchemy, and informs the oldest Hellenistic writings on Greco-Babylonian astrology. In a parallel tradition, Hermetic philosophy rationalized and systematized religious cult practices and offered the adept a means of personal ascension from the constraints of physical being. This latter tradition has led to the conflation of Hermeticism with the contemporaneously developing, but distinct, Gnosticism.\n\n\n== The epithet \"thrice great\" ==\n\nFowden asserts that the first datable occurrences of the epithet \"thrice great\" are in the Legatio of Athenagoras of Athens and in a fragment from Philo of Byblos, c. 64–141 CE. However, in a later work, Copenhaver reports that this epithet is first found in the minutes of a meeting of the council of the Ibis cult, held in 172 BCE near Memphis in Egypt. Hart explains that the epithet is derived from an epithet of Thoth found at the Temple of Esna, \"Thoth the great, the great, the great.\"\nMany Christian writers, including Lactantius, Augustine, Marsilio Ficino, Campanella, and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, as we",
