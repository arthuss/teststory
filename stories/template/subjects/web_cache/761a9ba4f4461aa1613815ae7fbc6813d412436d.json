  "text": "Arachnology (from Ancient Greek ἀράχνη (arákhnē), meaning \"spider\", and λόγος (lógos), meaning \"study\") is the scientific study of arachnids, which comprise spiders and related invertebrates such as scorpions, pseudoscorpions, harvestmen, ticks, and mites. Those who study spiders and other arachnids are arachnologists. More narrowly, the study of spiders alone (order Araneae) is known as araneology.\nThe word \"arachnology\" from Ancient Greek ἀράχνη (arákhnē), meaning \"spider\", and λόγος (lógos), meaning \"study\". The Ancient Greek word for \"spider\" itself refers to Arachne, the female protagonist of an ancient tale of the Greek Mythology.\n\n\n== Arachnology as a science ==\nArachnologists are primarily responsible for classifying arachnids and studying aspects of their biology. In the popular imagination, they are sometimes referred to as spider experts. Disciplines within arachnology include naming species and determining their evolutionary relationships to one another (taxonomy and systematics), studying how they interact with other members of their species and/or their environment (behavioural ecology), or how they are distributed in different regions and habitats (faunistics). Other arachnologists perform research on the anatomy or physiology of arachnids, including the venom of spiders and scorpions. Others study the impact of spiders in agricultural ecosystems and whether they can be used as biological control agents.\n\n\n=== Subdisciplines ===\nArachnology can be broken down into several specialties, including:\n\nacarology –  the study of ticks and mites\naraneology –  the study of spiders\nscorpiology – the study of scorpions\n\n\n=== Arachnological societies ===\nArachnologists are served by a number of scientific societies, both national and international in scope. Their main roles are to encourage the exchange of ideas between researchers, to organise meetings and congresses, and in a number of cases, to publish academic journals. Some are also involved in science outreach programs, such as the European spider of the year, which raise awareness of these animals among the general public.\nInternational\n\nInternational Society of Arachnology (ISA)  website\nAfrica\n\nAfrican Arachnological Society (AFRAS)  website\nAsia \n\nArachnological Society of Japan (ASJ) website\nAsian Society of Arachnology (ASA) website\nIndian Society of Arachnology website Archived 2017-01-02 at the Wayback Machine\nIranian Arachnological Society (IAS) website\nAustralasia\n\nAustralasian Arachnological Society website\nEurope\n\nAracnofilia – Associazione Italiana di Aracnologia website\nArachnologia Belgica – Belgian Arachnological Society (ARABEL) website\nArachnologische Gesellschaft (AraGes) website Archived 2016-10-23 at the Wayback Machine\nAssociation Francaise d'Arachnologie (AsFrA) website\nBritish Arachnological Society (BAS) website\nCzech Arachnological Society website\nEuropean Society of Arachnology (ESA) website\nGrupo Ibérico de Aracnologia (Iberian Peninsula) website\nMagyar Arachnolgia – Hungarian Arachnology\nNorth America\n\nAmerican Arachnological Society (AAS) website\n\n\n== Arachnological journals ==\nScientific journals devoted to the study of arachnids include:\n\nAcarologia\nActa Arachnologica – published by the Arachnological Society of Japan\nArachnida: Rivista Aracnologica Italiana\nArachnology – published by the British Arachnological Society\nArachnology Letters – published by the Arachnologische Gesellschaft\nInternational Journal of Acarology\nJournal of Arachnology – published by the American Arachnological Society\nRevista Ibérica de Aracnología – published by the Grupo Ibérico de Aracnología\nRevue Arachnologique\nSerket\n\n\n== Popular arachnology ==\nIn the 1970s, arachnids – particularly tarantulas – started to become popular as exotic pets. Many tarantulas consequently became more widely known by their common names, such as Mexican redknee tarantula for Brachypelma hamorii.\nVarious societies now focus on the husbandry, care, study, and captive breeding of tara",
